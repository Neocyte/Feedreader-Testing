## Background

In this project I was given a web-based application that read RSS feeds using Google's
Feed Reader API. The original developer of this application had already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. Before doing so, I needed to analyze the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to gain a better understanding of how the application functioned. These tests then verified the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Instructions

To access the feedreader, click [here](https://neocyte.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/).

Clicking on any of the links within each feed takes you to the respective web page.

Scrolling to the very bottom of the feed allows you to see the Jasmine testing framework.
Each green description represents a test that has passed. To view each test in more detail,
refer to the `feedreader.js` file located in the `jasmine/spec` folder.

## Contributing

This repository is based off of the starter code provided to _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
